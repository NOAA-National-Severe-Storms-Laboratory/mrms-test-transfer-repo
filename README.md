temp test repo I'm going to transfer

Even with online docs, etc.  I'm not 100% sure how transferring repos into a organization where I'm an owner but have SSO, CAC and other authentication goodies as well as other things.  So.  I'll just transfer this one as a test ginny pig.  If everything works as intended than I can move real repos.  Call me paranoid.  8)

Ok, I transferred this repo from my retoomey personal github to retoomeynoaa which is the SSO/idP account.  So in theory, now I can transfer it into the NSSL organization.  Wish me luck.  What will it do?  Hopefully I get an email and everything is happy.  Yay.

The issue I ran into is that I can't add retoomey to the organization unless I'm added to the idP that my enterprise is using...however my retoomeynoaa is setup for this.  So doing a double transfer might be the trick.  Going to try now.
